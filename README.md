A simple script that takes an .xlsx file generated by NEWARE BTS (Battery Testing System) 
Software and separates the data into CSV files easily readable by data analysis programs 
like Origin. 

The script requires Python 3 (tested with Python 3.8.0 32-bit and 64-bit versions).

The required libraries:
  * pandas (for creating dataframes from xlsx and converting them to csv)
  * xlrd (for reading xlsx files)
  
The script is intended for laboratory internal use and thus is in very crude form.

Use: run the script in the folder with xlsx files that need to be converted.

The function record_to_csv renders recorded curves into separate csv file.

The function cycle_to_csv renders recorded capacities into separate csv file.

The function xlsx_to_csv(file, mode="compact") uses to modes ("full" and "compact") with the "full"
version converting whole sheets and "compact" version leaving only essential data (capacity, cycles, voltage). 

The parameters should be changed manually as of now.

There is no difference between scripts in .py filetype and Jupyter Notebook (easier for testing purposes).
